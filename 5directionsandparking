<h1>Parking</h1>
<b>Parking in <a href="http://maps.msu.edu/interactive/index.php?location=GZDK">Ramp 6</a></b>
<p>Located on West Circle Drive, this parking garage is conveniently close to the MSU Union. Visitors may park here using only available "Pay By Plate" spots. The machine accepts multiple forms of payment, including cash, coins, and credit cards, however it does not make change. You can also pay and extend your time using the Spot On app (http://spoton.msu.edu).</p>

<b>Parking in Downtown East Lansing</b>
<p>Across Grand River Ave., there are plenty of parking options including the Albert Ave. Lot, the Grove St. Garage, the Charles St. Garage, the Division St. Garage, and the Bailey St. Lot. These attended parking options run at the rate of $0.75 per half hour. <a href="https://www.cityofeastlansing.com/DocumentCenter/View/723">Click here</a> to see more about these options.</p>

<b>Parking in <a href="http://maps.msu.edu/interactive/index.php?location=51PV">Lot 62w</a></b>
<p>Located south of the Red Cedar River, this option is only ten minutes away from the MSU Union and nearby the MSU Main Library. The parking rate is $0.80 per half hour for visitors, higher than the rates in downtown East Lansing.</p>

<b>Other Parking Options</b>
<p>Metered parking is available outside of the MSU Union for a limited number of hours. Be sure to pay attention to the time limit and rates for your specific meter.
